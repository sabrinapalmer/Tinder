Homework 4

I worked alone.

For this homework, I made 4 classes.
	In User, I constructed a user with the same input data values in the JSON file.
I also included a list of matches for each users to store thier matches.
Then I made methods to add matches and find matches etc. so that I could work with the users.
	In Link, I constructed a link with two users and added each user to the other users matches list.
	In Tinder, I constructed two lists: a users list and a links list to store the matches that were made.
Then I made the method addUser which checks if the users list already has the user.
If it does not, I added the new user to the ArrayList of users and then moved on to check if the new user should be matched with any previous users.
To do this, I made a for loop that traversed the list of users and checked if the following conditions were satisfied with each user and the new user:
		1. If the gender of the new user is the same as the gender the previous user is interested in.
		2. If the gender of the previous user is the same as the gender the new user is interested in.
		3. If the distance between them is less than the default radius of 10 miles. (this can easily be changed to r where r is min(v1.radius, v2.radius)  )
If those conditions are satisfied with any other user and a new user, a link is created between the new user and the old one.
	In myTinder, I used org.json.simple parser to parse the JSON file of users. 
For each user in the JSON file, I parsed each new data as the appropriate data type in Java (String or double).
Then I made a new user with the data I just parsed and ran the addUser with the new user.
